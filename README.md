NeuroBank AI – Natural Language Processing in Prolog
- A Prolog-powered natural language processing (NLP) system for querying structured financial data.


🚀 Overview

    migiGPT is a Prolog-based NLP system that processes natural language queries and extracts structured information from a financial database.
    It uses logical reasoning and pattern matching to handle queries about bank accounts, people, locations, and balances.

📌 Features

    ✅ Lexical Parsing – Parses and understands natural language queries
    ✅ Prolog-Based Knowledge Representation – Stores financial data using logical facts & rules
    ✅ Entity Recognition – Identifies people, banks, locations, and account details
    ✅ Preposition Handling – Supports queries with "of", "from", "in", and "with"
    ✅ Logical Query Processing – Finds the best-matching answers using structured inference

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Prolog (SWI-Prolog)
    Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    Knowledge Representation & Reasoning
    Logic-Based Query Processing

📦 Installation & Setup

    1. Install SWI-Prolog - brew install swi-prolog
    2.Clone repo -> git clone https://github.com/shaghayegh0/migiGPT.git
    3. Run Prolog -> swipl migiGPT.pl

🧩 How It Works

    Database Rules: Defines facts about people, banks, locations, and accounts
    Lexicon & Grammar: Recognizes nouns, adjectives, prepositions for NLP parsing
    Logical Inference: Uses Prolog rules to derive answers from structured queries
